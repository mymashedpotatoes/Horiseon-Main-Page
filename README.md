Why did you do this project?:

I did this project to help the website meet accessibility standards and to optimize their code to be more condensed. 


What problem does it solve?:

This solved the problem of not being accessible to those with disabilities. Each image has a description and the title correctly reflects the webpage.


What did you learn?:

In this I learned more about condensing css code to make it easier to read and image alt's.
