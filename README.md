Horiseon Main Page

This is the main page for horiseon so possible clients can see what they do and how they can help.


Why did you do this project?:

I did this project to help the website meet accessibility standards and to optimize their code to be more condensed and readable.


What problem does it solve?:

This solved the problem of not being accessible to those with disabilities. Each image has a description and the title correctly reflects the webpage. Also, the code not being very readable to the coder.


What did you learn?:

In this I learned more about condensing css code to make it easier to read and image alt's.
